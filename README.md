This repository contains the code segments for the experiments conducted in `Few-Shot Learning for Medical Image Segmentation: A Review And Comparative Study`. 
We provide specific implementation steps we followed for training SSL-ALP-Net [1] on the Kits-23 Tumour Segmentation dataset. We encourage users to use our pre-processing/modal
training codes for their experimentation purposes.
